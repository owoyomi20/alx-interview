# 0x06-starwars_api

This project is about using the Star Wars API (SWAPI) to get information about the characters and films in the Star Wars universe.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Requests library

## Usage

To run the script, execute:

```bash
./0-starwars_characters.py <film_id>
```

where `<film_id>` is the id of the film you want to get information about. For example:

```bash
./0-starwars_characters.py 4
```

This will print the names of the characters that appear in the film with id 4, which is "The Empire Strikes Back".

## Output

The output will be a list of names, one per line, in the same order as they appear in the film. For example:

```bash
Darth Vader
Luke Skywalker
Han Solo
Leia Organa
...
```
